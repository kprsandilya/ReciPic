Be careful not to burn the garlic.\n2.  **Cook the celeriac:** Add the diced celeriac to the pot and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, to lightly brown the edges.\n3.  **Add broth and simmer:** Pour in the vegetable broth (or chicken broth). Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the celeriac is tender and easily pierced with a fork.\n4.  **Blend the soup:** Carefully transfer the soup to a blender (or use an immersion blender).
