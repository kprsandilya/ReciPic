Blend until smooth. Let the batter sit for 5-10 minutes to allow the oats to absorb some of the liquid and thicken slightly. If you don't have a blender, you can mash the bananas very well and then whisk all the ingredients together in a bowl, ensuring the oats are well incorporated.\n2.  **Heat the Pan:** Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. The pan is ready when a drop of water sizzles and evaporates quickly.\n3.  **Cook the Pancakes:** Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the hot griddle for each pancake. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Flip carefully with a spatula.\n4.  **Serve:** Serve immediately with your favorite toppings.
