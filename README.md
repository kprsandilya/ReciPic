# ReciPic

## About the Project
A lot of people don't know what to do with all the ingredients stored in the fridge or are clueless to how many different dishes their subset of ingredients can produce. ReciPic solves this issue by providing the user with a list of complete and/or uncomplete recipes as suggestions for what the user should eat next. ReciPic is both a mobile app and Chrome extension. After the user logins using Firebase for authentication, the user is redirected to a camera from which they can snap a series of pictures of their fridge. This images are stored in their own personal folders on Firebase, from which our model processes, identifying the user's current ingredients and prompts Gemini for a new set of ingredients. The user is then displayed these recipes which may be complete or incomplete. If the recipes are incomplete, this is where the Chrome extension comes into play, which buy the remaining ingredients online from Walmart automatically.
